# Textures for My Dearest Alice.

All are provided in either 256x256 or 128x128, seeing as that's what the PS1 supported. 

A horizontal texture may use 512x256 or 256x128, but these are rare. 

They have gone through minimal editing and look best when shaded with the vertexlit shader you can find in Shaders.

The Demo build uses an old group of textures that no longer exists. You will not find them here. These are for the full version of the game.
